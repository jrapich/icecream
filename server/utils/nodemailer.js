//import nodemailer
//import anything else we need for nodemialer

//define vars needed for nodemailer
//is this accounts: IMAP info? auth? etc

//create necessary objects/classes/functions for nodemailer to operate

//create an exportable function for handling nodemailer data as arguments
//and return either a fufilled or reject promise based on:
//1 if the needed data was passed,
//2 if the request passed to nodemailer was successful or not.
//consider wrapping all of this with OOP into an exportable class, if possible
